Atkinson Hyperlegible is a great typeface but with a few design choices that were still difficult to get accustomed to after extensive usage.

Hyperreadable changes these and makes some minor alterations for a more neutral look while keeping a good amount of legibility.

**0 and O**: The slash has been removed from the 0 since it can be distracting when text is small or bold. The zero is now slightly more narrow, and the capital O is now slightly wider for increased legibility.

**6**: The 6 is no longer curved at the top. It was frequently being confused for the 8 or the slashed 0.

**8**: The 8 is more conventional. The wide-bottom 8 is a hallmark of Atkinson Hyperlegible, but the smaller top half seemed to vanish when text was small or bold. Even at larger sizes, the shape was somewhat distracting.

*(Even with the blurry demo they provide, the conventional 8 on the left is easily distinguishable from the capital B)*

**i**: The serif on the lowercase i has been removed for a more plain look.

**f, j, l, t**: These lowercase letters are slightly more rounded.

**q**: The lowercase q has a shorter tail. This can also help add more space before certain characters:

The asymmetrical spurs on several characters have been made symmetrical:

Overall, the differences are mostly subtle unless the text is large, bold, or contains numbers:
